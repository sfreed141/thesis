\chapter{Results}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Test setup
    \begin{itemize}
        \item hardware used
        \item scene information (models, textures). multiple scenes would be good\ldots
        \item render resolution + other settings
    \end{itemize}
    \item Screenshots with commentary
    \begin{itemize}
        \item voxel textures
        \item complete scene with and without indirect illumination
    \end{itemize}
    \item Timing breakdown for render passes (w/ different settings in table or something)
    \item Evaluation of voxel warping (voxel textures; screenshots with and without; performance penalty; different warping functions?)
    \item Evaluation of integrating into other engines?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Voxelization only requires a way to draw scene
        \item Radiance injection needs RSMs
        \item Shader code could be abstracted to only require position, surface normal (and TBN?)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
